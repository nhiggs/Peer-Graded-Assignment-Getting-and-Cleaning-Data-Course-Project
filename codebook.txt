Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

IMPORTANT NOTE:

When running the script 'run_analysis.R' ALL variable names are set to
lower case and have symbols such as '-' and '()' removed to keep them tidy. This
is to ensure that the variable names in the output 'tidydata.txt' adhere to
common principles of tidy data (as outlined in lecture by Jeff Leak).
For example 'tBodyAcc-mean()-X' is edited to 'tbodyaccmeanx'

Furthermore, each variable EXCEPT for 'subject' and 'activity' is an average over
the corresponding subject-activity grouping. Due to there being over 80 variables
that are averages, the variable names where left as is instead of adding the word
'mean' or 'average' to every column.
